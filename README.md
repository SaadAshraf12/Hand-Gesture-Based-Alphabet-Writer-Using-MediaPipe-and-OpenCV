# Hand-Gesture-Based-Alphabet-Writer-Using-MediaPipe-and-OpenCV
This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to create a hand gesture-based alphabet writer. The webcam captures hand landmarks to recognize gestures. The "write" gesture cycles through alphabet letters, while the "next" gesture appends the current letter to the text. This provides an interactive way to write letters and form words using hand movements.


Experience the future of writing with our Hand Gesture-Based Alphabet Writer! Utilizing MediaPipe and OpenCV, this innovative project transforms hand movements into alphabet letters. Simply use intuitive gestures to cycle through and select letters, creating words effortlessly. Perfect for interactive displays and accessibility solutions. Revolutionize your interaction with technology today!
